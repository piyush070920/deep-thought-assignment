Here I used HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.

### To overcome the CORS policy error.
- There is a Server folder contains a temporary server inside index.js that fetch content from the link provided by deep thought.
- Frontend JS request data from server
- Server port is 4000 and WebUI is 5500
- To run server: open terminal > cd server > npm run dev
- To run webUI: VScode > run live server + live sass compiler
